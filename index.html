                <div class="subtitle">Research Assitant at Lee Nano-Optics Lab</div>
                <div class="bio_text">Hey, I'm Massee! Welcome to my webpage portfolio I built as part of my final project for
                    <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/">Harvard's CS50</a>.</div>
                <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
                <div class="bio_text">I went to California High School in the East Bay Area of Northern California. During my junior year, I had the
                    incredible privilege to study abroad in France at the American School of Grenoble. Upon return to Cal High
                    for my final year after an immersive year as an exchange student, I had set my eyes upon UC Irvine's undergraduate program in 
                    Biological Sciences. 
                </div>
                <div class="bio_text">
                    My initial exposure to the physical sciences began with the  General Chemistry sequence, but it all changed when
                    I began Calculus I. I came in with a shaky foundation of precalculus and trigonometry. During the length of the first two weeks of 
                    Calculus I, I felt I had reached my mental limit spending the first few hours of each morning trying to wrap my head around the subject
                    and feeling completely overwhelemed and inadequate. Through the toil, however, there was a growing desire towards absorbing the material.
                    After deep work and focus, I had scored a 39/40 on the first midterm examination exactly five weeks from the start of the course. A couple 
                    hours later, my score changed to 40/40, the answer key had a mistake. I was delighted, but it did not come to me as a surprise. This was 
                    the first of many times that I would enter the time warp– the intellectual black-hole where I would meet my limit, and through diligence,
                    optimism, and persistence of thinking I would grow. A wave of content and a sense of accomplishment. All it took was
                    five weeks to go from learning basic trigonometric functions to applying the chain rule for to derivatives.
                </div>
                <div class="bio_text">
                    During my freshman year, I was exposed to the physical sciences. Courses in general chemistry and calculus. I musterd up the courage to
                    make a switch into the Applied Physics major. Shortly thereafter, I declared a double major in mathematics and enrolled in core computer
                    science courses. During this time, I had the oppurtunity and privilege to join Dr. Howard Lee's Nanophotonics Laboratory and work under my
                    graduate student mentor David Dang to employ novel machine learning models to tackle physical problems.

                I came into UCI as a Bio Sci major, and as I was exposed to mathematics and the physical sciences, I mustered
                up the courage and made the transition into Applied Physics at the end of my third year. I have declared
                a double major in mathematics middway into my fourth year. After taking my first computer science and programming
                this fall, I am pursuing core computer science courses and plan to attend graduate school for further studies in 
                computer science.
